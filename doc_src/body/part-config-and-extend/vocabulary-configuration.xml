  <title>Configuration</title>
  <body>
    <p>Configuration is the task of taking existing vocabulary and constraint modules and combining
      them together to define a DITA document type.</p>
    <p>You do configuration by creating new document type shells, which are DTD or XSD files that
      serve as manifests of the vocabulary modules that make up the DITA document types.</p>
    <p>Configuration can also involve the creation of new constraint modules.</p>
    <p>As an implementation activity, creating new document type shells is an entirely mechanical
      process that requires no knowledge of DTD or XSD syntax. The tutorials demonstrate the
      mechanical process. Likewise, because the process is entirely mechanical (meaning it requires
      no creative thought or invention), it can be automated, as it has been by Jarno Elovirta and
      his DITA DTD Generator (<xref href="http://dita-generator.appspot.com/" format="html"
        scope="external">http://dita-generator.appspot.com/</xref>).</p>
    <p>The development of constraint modules requires a bit more DTD or XSD knowledge, but it is
      also a largely mechanical process because it is always about removing or constraining existing
      things, not adding new things. Therefore, it does not require invention, only analysis of
      requirements and modification of existing declarations.</p>
