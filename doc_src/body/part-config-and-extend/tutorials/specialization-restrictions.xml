    <p>A key aspect of specialization is that while you can add new element types
        to the base DITA types, you cannot make the content models of these new 
        element types <i>less</i> restrictive than the content models of their
        base types. That is, if the base type "foo" has the content model "required
        'A' followed by optional 'B'", you cannot define a specialization of
        "foo" that makes 'A' (or a specialization of 'A') optional. By the same
        token, because the base content model requires 'A',
        your specialization of "foo" must require 'A' or a specialization
        of 'A'. However, because 'B' is optional in the base content model, your 
        specialization of "foo" can omit 'B' entirely.</p>
    <p>However, you <i>can</i> make the specialized content models <i>more</i>
        restrictive. Thus, you could have your specialization of "foo" require
        both 'A' <i>and</i> 'B'.</p>
    <p>The formal way to define this rule is in terms of "generalization", such that 
        if from a document instance that uses specialized elements you generated a new
        instance that used the base types of each element, would that new instance
        always be valid against the base declarations? If the answer is "yes", then
        your specialization is valid. If the answer is "no" then your specialization is 
        not valid.</p>
