    <p>Starting with DITA 1.1, the DITA specification defines both DTD and XSD Schema
        versions of the DITA document types. The basic patterns for organizing topic, map,
        and domain specialization modules are the same for DTDs and schemas but there are
        detail differences reflecting the different features and syntaxes of the two
        document constraint languages.</p>
    <p>This tutorial will eventually be provided into two versions, one for DTD-based
        specializations and one for schema-based specializations. However, until the DITA
        Open Toolkit properly supports schema-based specializations, there is no point
        in creating schema-based specializations.</p>
    <p>Once you understand how to create DTD-based specializations, transferring that 
        knowledge to schema-based specialization is straightforward.</p>
