    <p>Using an XML editor and the test concept you created in step 2
        above, first verify that the document is still valid, which verifies that you didn't break
        anything in doing the integration of concept.dtd. If that succeeds, then 
        add a <xmlelement>conbody</xmlelement>, a <xmlelement>p</xmlelement>, and verify that you can now
        add any of the XML domain elements within a paragraph.</p>
    <p>If this succeeds, you're done. You have successfully defined a new domain and integrated
        it into a shell document type. Now all you have to do is repeat (that is copy) the 
        shell integrations into the other shells you'll be using the domain with.</p>
    <p>The next step, if needed, is to add domain-specific functionality to your DITA processors.
        For the XML domain, that means updating output processors to create the formatting
        effects for the different XML component mention elements.</p>
