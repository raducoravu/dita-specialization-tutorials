  <title>Element Domain Specialization Step 4: Integrate The Module Into a Document Type Shell</title>
  <shortdesc><term>Integration</term> is the process of modifying a document type shell DTD to include different modules. It is also a purely mechanical process.</shortdesc>
  <body>
    <p>The first thing you should do is make local copies of all the DITA-provided shell DTDs, even
            if you don't change them in any way. This prepares you for the inevitable time when you
            want to add or remove domains or otherwise configure or extend from the base DITA
            types.</p>
    <p>Note that the order in which the .ent and .mod files are included into the shell DTD is very
            important. This is because in DTDs, the order of occurrence of parameter entity
            declarations is significant. In XML, the first declaration of a given entity name wins,
            so to override entities defined in other included files, you must declare that entity
            first. Thus, you import the .ent files first, which provides the module-specific entity
            declarations that override the default definitions provided in the .mod files. Then you
            define the values of any configuration parameter entities, and then you include the .mod
            files, which use the configuration parameter entities to define the effective values for
            content models and attribute lists.</p>
