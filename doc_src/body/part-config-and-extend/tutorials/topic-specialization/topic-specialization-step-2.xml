  <title>Topic Specialization Step 2: Declare the Topic Module Element Types</title>
  <body>
    <p>The topic declarations go in a file called
                <filepath><varname>modulename</varname>.mod</filepath>, where <q>modulename</q> is
            usually the same as the tagname of the specialized topic element, in this case
                <filepath>faq-question.mod</filepath>.</p>
    <p>To get started, the easiest thing to do is copy an existing topic module, either the one for the base you're specializing from, or one that is similar to the specialization you want to create.</p>
